A program which tests the knowledge of the user against key terms.

There are two text files which the program requires

  - look at the latest mark of a student in comparison to their previous attempt to see their progress.
  - create the word file by entering the 10 words that the test requires
  - the student records file can be searched for a student and it will show their scores

  - the test can be taken by entering their name, the password is set to studentNAME where NAME is the name entered.
